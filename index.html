                    Hi! My name is Hillwood Chan. Yep, I know. You are probably thinking I have never heard of that name before. This is my first web page ;) All of my friends call me Hill. I was born in San Jose, California, but grew up in Hong Kong. I came back to the state when I was 14. I graduated with a Biology degree in CSUN. I worked as a sales professional for 8 years for luxury brands. I want a career change as a Full Stack Developer. Thats why I'm so looking forward for this bootcamp. I CAN'T WAIT to finish the program and go on my next chapter of my life!
